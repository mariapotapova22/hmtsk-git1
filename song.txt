Did you ever want it?
Did you want it bad?
Oh my, it tears me apart
Did you ever fight it?
All of the pain
So much pride
Running through my veins
Bleeding, I am bleeding
My cold little heart
Oh I, I cant stand myself
And I know in my heart
In this cold heart
I can live or I can die
I believe if I just try
You believe in you and I
In you and I
In you and I
In you and I
